# PlantClassification (Academic project)
Base code for training and testing different keras base models in order to fine the best results for the Urban Planter dataset.
The code differs according to the experiments.

# Summary
Plant classification requires the eye of a botanist, as the subtle differences in stem or petals can differentiate between different species. Thus, accurate automatic plant classification may be of great help for a person who is studying agriculture, traveling or doing research on rare species.
This project presents Urban Planter which is a new Dataset for classification of plant species with 1500 images classified into 15 categories. The set mainly covers
species of houseplants that grow in a desert climate and are barely covered by existing data sets.

# Experiments

Application of some deep neural networks on Oxford 102 Flower dataset and Urban Planter dataset.
Experiment 1: Training of the Urban Planter data set.
Experiment 2: Training Oxford 102 dataset and transfer learning on Urban dataset.
Experiment 3: Training an Urban Planter Dataset with ImageNet weights.
Experiment 4: Training Oxford 102 Data Set with ImageNet weights and transfer learning on a data set Urban Planter.
